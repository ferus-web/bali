## 21.4.1.1 Time Values and Time Range
## Time measurement in ECMAScript is analogous to time measurement in POSIX, in particular sharing definition in terms of the proleptic Gregorian calendar, an epoch of midnight at the beginning of 1 January 1970 UTC, and an accounting of every day as comprising exactly 86,400 seconds (each of which is 1000 milliseconds long).
## An ECMAScript time value is a Number, either a finite integral Number representing an instant in time to millisecond precision or NaN representing no specific instant. A time value that is a multiple of 24 √ó 60 √ó 60 √ó 1000 = 86,400,000 (i.e., is 86,400,000 √ó d for some integer d) represents the instant at the start of the UTC day that follows the epoch by d whole UTC days (preceding the epoch for negative d). Every other finite time value t is defined relative to the greatest preceding time value s that is such a multiple, and represents the instant that occurs within the same UTC day as s but follows it by (t - s) milliseconds.
## Time values do not account for UTC leap seconds‚Äîthere are no time values representing instants within positive leap seconds, and there are time values representing instants removed from the UTC timeline by negative leap seconds. However, the definition of time values nonetheless yields piecewise alignment with UTC, with discontinuities only at leap second boundaries and zero difference outside of leap seconds.
## A Number can exactly represent all integers from -9,007,199,254,740,992 to 9,007,199,254,740,992 (21.1.2.8 and 21.1.2.6). A time value supports a slightly smaller range of -8,640,000,000,000,000 to 8,640,000,000,000,000 milliseconds. This yields a supported time value range of exactly -100,000,000 days to 100,000,000 days relative to midnight at the beginning of 1 January 1970 UTC.
## The exact moment of midnight at the beginning of 1 January 1970 UTC is represented by the time value +0ùîΩ.
