# Agnipath
Agnipath (literally means "path of fire" in Hindi, I like to think of it as "hotpath") is the highest-tier JIT compiler in Bali. It aims to minimize boxing+unboxing and also produce the best quality code possible, no matter how much time it takes.

It uses a SSA IR form to make certain optimizations trivial.

**It currently does not exist, I am planning to work on it soon.**
