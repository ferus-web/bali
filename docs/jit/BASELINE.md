# The Baseline Compiler
Bali's baseline compiler is a fairly naive, simple (~440 LoC) JIT compiler that directly translates the VM's bytecode structures to native x86-64 code.

It does not attempt to perform any optimizations, as its goal is to generate machine code with as low of a latency as possible.
As such, the code generated by it tends to be of very poor quality.

# Function Compilation Eligibility
A function becomes eligible to be compiled by this tier when it occupies 25% of all the bytecode execution dispatches in the interpreter, after 50,000 total dispatches have been hit. If not, then the function continues to be executed by the interpreter (pulsar).

# Optimizations
This tier is a 1:1 bytecode to machine code translator. It does not perform _ANY_ optimizations, because the goal is for it to be as fast as possible.
